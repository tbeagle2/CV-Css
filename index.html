<!--Block elements. A span allows us to select a section of your text to let
your format it or style it differently.
It's considered an inline display element.
It only takes up as much space that it needs to be.
Others are images and anchors tags. they don't take up an entire block
But with inline elements you can't change the width -->
<!--Position - Static, Relative, Absolute, fixed
All html elements are static by default. It just means go along with the
html rules and go by the default
Relative - it allows us to position our selection relative to
how it would've been had it been static. Basically any css would be based
on it's static Position. Remember that if it's moved, it doesn't change
anything else on the screen. If we say right: 30px, it will move the element
right of where it used to be.
Absolute - we are positioning the element relative to it parent.
So if we say right: 30px, it will all a 30 margin to the right, moving the
element to the right. Using position: absolute it removes it from the flow of
the page. So the other elements ignore it.
If you have a relative div and an absolute element in it, it will be defined by
the div and not the full body.
Fixed: it stays in a fixed position no matter what.
